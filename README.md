## 🧠 Software Overview

**COMSOL Multiphysics** is a high-performance simulation platform designed for engineers, researchers, and scientists who need to model complex systems across multiple physical domains. The software allows detailed analysis of interactions between structural, thermal, fluid, and electromagnetic effects within a single unified environment.

Its flexible equation-based modeling approach gives users complete control over physical parameters, boundary conditions, and material properties. This adaptability makes it ideal for both standard engineering challenges and highly specialized research projects, allowing users to simulate real-world scenarios with exceptional accuracy.

COMSOL’s intuitive interface, combined with powerful solvers, streamlines the process of refining models, testing different scenarios, and visualizing results. Users can iteratively improve designs and predict system behavior before committing to costly physical prototypes.
